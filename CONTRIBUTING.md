# Contributor's Guide

## Communication

- Respect each other. No form of discrimination or harassment will be tolerated.
- Using inclusive terminology. Examples include:
    - Use a “main” branch instead of a “master” branch.
    - Use “blocklist” and “allowlist” instead of “blacklist” and “whitelist”.
    - Use “primary” and “secondary” instead of “master” and “slave”.
- Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/playtron-os/playtron-os/issues) to report bugs, security issues, or to open new feature requests.

# Contributing

There are three main ways to contribute:

- Testing.
    - The simplest way you can help contribute is to test out our project. Have new ideas or ran into issues? Open up a GitHub Issue with details to let us know.
- Documentation.
    - Help add new [documentation](https://github.com/playtron-os/playtron-os/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adocumentation) or reorganize existing documentation.
- Code.
    - Contribute new [features](https://github.com/playtron-os/playtron-os/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) and [bug fixes](https://github.com/playtron-os/playtron-os/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).

Look for GitHub Issues that have the label “[good first issue](https://github.com/playtron-os/playtron-os/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)” for simpler GitHub Issues to get started with.

# Pull Request Workflow

A pull request (PR) is required for any code to be merged into the project.

- Create a PR with detailed information about what the purpose is.
- Respond to feedback of the PR in a reasonable amount of time. Otherwise, it may be closed.
- Before merging, the pull request must meet these requirements:
    - Formatting is consistent with existing code.
    - Passes all GitHub Actions CI tests.
    - Approved by at least one Playtron employee.

By submitting code to our project, you agree to the terms of the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 agreement.
